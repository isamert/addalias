# Info
Addalias is a simple tool for adding/editing your alias commands. You can use it with a simple GUI or you can use it with commandline.

Alias is a command for creating shortcuts for other commands. For example, if you are using Ubuntu, everytime you want to install a program you have to type "sudo apt-get install". You can install programs with just typing "install". What you have to do is add an alias to this command. Aliases are stored in ~/.bashrc. This tool adds/edits aliases easily without touching the file.

## INSTALLING:
Just download the package, extract it. Enter in the "src" folder. Open terminal here and type "python addalias.py --install". Now you can use by just typing "addalias".
